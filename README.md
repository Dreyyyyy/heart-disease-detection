# A data analysis project focused on detecting whether a patient has heart disease or not.
Some key things to note:
* The primary evaluation metric used was Accuracy;
* 4 models was tested:
  1. RandomForest;
  2. LogisticRegression;
  3. KNN;
  4. XGBoost.
* The model with the best accuracy result is LogisticRegression;
* All the necessary libraries are on the enviroment.yml file;
* To replicate it, just create a new conda enviroment using conda env create -f environment.yml
